# Comma Tater

Add punctuation to long numbers for improved readability.

Most of the code is ~~shamelessly ripped off from~~ inspired by [Cloud-to-butt.](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt/)

Idea from a post in [One Sentence Startup Pitches.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1500321840185061/permalink/1635141953369715/)

# TODO

- A logo that's a potato in the shape of a comma
- Chrome compatibility (?)
- Configurable commas versus dots (for other locales)

# BUGS

Probably.
